# CS445-Final-Project
Final project for CS445
by Arindam Saha (saha2@illinois.edu) and Kirsten Gillam (kgillam2@illinois.edu)

### Code

The main jupyter notebook is `3D-FocusStack.ipynb` and should be runnable as-is. We have separated helper functions into `utils.py` and `focusstack.py`.

We used a conda environment to manage our python dependencies. The required packages are:
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV
- Pillow
- PyTorch
- Transformers
- Open3D
- Cvxpy

The required data can be found in the `images/` folder.
